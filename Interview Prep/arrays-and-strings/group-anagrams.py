# Given Test Case
# Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"],
# Output:
# [
#   ["ate","eat","tea"],
#   ["nat","tan"],
#   ["bat"]
# ]


# class Solution:


# Objective:  Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.
# Anagrams are words with the same number of letters, and the same count of each letters.
# Thus, to check if two words are anagrams check that for each letter they have the same countself.






# Algorithm 2
"""
    Complexity: Time: O( N * k*log(k) ), Space( N ) , N is number of strings in input array, k is length of longest string.

    Iterate through the strings,
        Use the fact that for n > 2 words are anagrams if they are the same character sequence when sorted and
            Use a hashmap to check for equality,
        Append Acorrdingly,

    Return the grouping.

    Takeaway:
         - Optimization doesn't matter until you have a solution.
         - Be mentally prepared to write a brute force step by step solution. The optimized solution often enough
         exists within the brute force solution.
         - Be prepared to work on a problem for an hour, until I start to really get the hang of things, 


    I think the key thing here was realizing that I could decrease the complexity of my eqaulity check by
    using a hashmap. This idea lead me to the idea of coming up with an anagramID that would quickly let me check
    eqaulity in anagram terms. Then I looked at the solution and saw that the sorted string was a handy id.
